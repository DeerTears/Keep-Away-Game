I started this project on December 1st and first published this repo December 15th.

This is the largest coding project I've ever taken on, and I've already restarted the project twice. I consider my custom classes and statemachines to be okay, but the scoring code, the UI code, and the reliance on a Singleton need to be broken down and simplified.

I've had too many unplanned ideas during the creation of this prototype and I did not hesitate to introduce new, unfinished gamemodes that are still lingering in the code right now. Hopefully I can take some time to refactor this project (in a clean folder, restarting the project a third time) so it's even more streamlined and easier to work with.

My inspiration for this game was initially Potion Wolf: bitzawolf.itch.io/potion-wolf, an arcade singleplayer game about combining potions under a time limit. I wanted to create a FPS multiplayer splitscreen version of it after seeing some Goldeneye splitscreen multiplayer footage. After a failed attempt to make a potion-combining game, what I ended up with was instead a game about whacking balls in first person to score points. I am looking to cartoony sportsy games as my next set of inspirations.
